# unapologetically finding out

my PC is handled with care, generally speaking.

u know i really thought i could just slam x86 assembly into the dormancy of memory
and then i messed up because just when i > haha yis i shall rededicate sum time to my real passion: haha funni at&t bell labs "article possibly contains original research" techno computer geneology
and go out and do thing learn thing
and then the sudden terror strikes in my heart
that the 1 0s were g o n e
and this was all just a sick joke of planned obsolescence
but i actually have better theories
and as such i will be pursuing my interests.
